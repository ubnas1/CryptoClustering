# CryptoClustering

In this project, I have used unsupervised learning to make clusters of cryptocurrencies by finding similarities of price change.

I have used 24-hour and 7-day price change as components for the cluster formation.

To find optimum number of clusters, I have used Elbow method to plot the line and visualise the graph to find the suitable number of clusters.

I have used KMeans Model to make clusters.

I have also used PCA to reduce the number of components and plotted the results again to study that if it makes a difference in cluster visualisations.

To make it easy to visualise and study, I have plotted composite charts at the end of my project.
